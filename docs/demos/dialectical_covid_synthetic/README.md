# Synthetic Dialectical COVID System (Demonstration)

This module demonstrates how a dialectical system:
- detects contradictions,
- applies dynamic thresholds,
- identifies qualitative transitions (events),
- and produces event-oriented predictions.

⚠️ Important:
This system uses **synthetic, hand‑constructed data**.
It is **not an empirical validation** and does **not claim predictive accuracy**.

Its purpose is **conceptual and methodological**:
to show how dialectical logic can be operationalized.
