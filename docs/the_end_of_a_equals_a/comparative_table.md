# Comparative Table  
Formal Logic and Dialectical‑Genetic Logic  
(Xenopoulos)

| Aspect | Formal (Traditional) Logic | Dialectical‑Genetic Logic |
|------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Identity | Static (A = A) | Genetic (A → A′) |
| Contradiction | Logical error | Generative necessity |
| Negation | Exclusion (¬A) | Internal opposition (¬ᴰA) |
| Time | External parameter | Logical dimension |
| Change | Extra‑logical | Logically necessary |
| Development | Empirical process | Logical consequence |
| Dialectics | Philosophical method | Logical architecture |
| Ontology | Stable being | Becoming |
| Epistemology | Representation | Historical comprehension |

This comparison does not present two equivalent logics in opposition.
It articulates the transformation of formal logic and the qualitative
leap that gives rise to dialectical‑genetic logic.
