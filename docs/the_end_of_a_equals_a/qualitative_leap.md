# Ontological and Epistemological Qualitative Leap

While the transition appears as a transformation at the logical level,
it constitutes a qualitative leap at the ontological and
epistemological levels.

Ontologically, reality is no longer conceived as a collection of
self-identical entities undergoing external change. Being itself is
historical, contradictory, and generative.

Epistemologically, knowledge is no longer the representation of static
objects, but the comprehension of processes, contradictions, and
emergent forms.

This leap is qualitative because:
- contradiction becomes productive rather than pathological,
- time becomes constitutive rather than parametric,
- and becoming becomes a logical necessity rather than an empirical
  accident.

The leap is not arbitrary. It is generated by the accumulated
contradictions that formal logic cannot resolve within its own
framework.

Thus, the dialectical‑genetic logic represents a new logical regime,
not merely a refined technique.
