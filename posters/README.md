# Conference Posters

This folder contains a series of academic posters presented at the  
**54th Annual Meeting of the Jean Piaget Society**, held in **Belgrade, Serbia**,  
from **May 29 to May 31, 2025**.

The posters are based on the philosophical and epistemological work of  
**Epameinondas Xenopoulos (1920–1994)**, as developed in his book  
*Epistemology of Logic: Logic‑Dialectic or Theory of Knowledge*.

All posters were **created, synthesized, and presented in 2025 by his daughter,
Katerina Xenopoulou**, who also carried out the mathematical and computational
implementations using contemporary AI‑assisted tools, strictly grounded in
Xenopoulos’ original theoretical model.

## Posters in This Collection

### 1. From Static Logic to Dynamic Synthesis  
**Xenopoulos' Fourth Logical Structure**

Introduces the Fourth Logical Structure as a dynamic extension of Jean Piaget’s
static cognitive structures, emphasizing contradiction, reversibility, and
dialectical synthesis as mechanisms of cognitive evolution.

### 2. Practical Logic  
**The Fusion of Formal and Dialectical Logic**

Presents *Practical Logic* as a meta‑logical framework unifying formal logic and
dialectical logic, addressing contradiction, change, and reasoning in complex
systems.

### 3. The Dialectical Logic  
**A Model for Managing Contradictions in Artificial Intelligence**

Explores the application of dialectical logic to artificial intelligence,
treating contradiction as a productive mechanism for learning, adaptation, and
decision‑making.

### 4. How Xenopoulos Mathematicized Dialectical Evolution  
**Through Jean Piaget’s INRC Operators**

Demonstrates how dialectical evolution can be expressed mathematically through
Jean Piaget’s INRC operators, forming a formal structure for reversibility and
synthesis.

## 5. The Dynamic Interaction Between System and Environment  
### The N[Fi(Gj)] and N[E1(G1)] Formulas of Epameinondas Xenopoulos

Presented at the 54th Annual Meeting of the Jean Piaget Society (Belgrade, 2025).

## Note on AI‑Assisted Implementation

AI‑based tools were used as technical and programming assistants for the
mathematical modeling, simulations, and visualizations presented in these
posters. All theoretical concepts and logical structures originate from the work
of Epameinondas Xenopoulos (†1994).
